# Photo app that displays a list of photos from a server.

Main Page

Consists of a segmented control which switches the display between two views using a flipping animation. 

Those two views are:

The table view will list photos
  - Each row will contain a thumbnail of the photo, its title and description.
  - The height of each row should be dynamic to accommodate the full title and description.


The map will plot the same photos
  - Each annotation view callout will show a thumbnail and title of the photo

Detail Page

- The detail page is accessible by tapping a row in the table view or the detail arrow in an annotation viewâ€™s callout bubble on the map.
- The detail page will have a larger version of the photo along with its description at the bottom and title at the top in the nav bar
- Tapping on the back button will take the user back to the main page
